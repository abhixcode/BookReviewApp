BookReviewApp is a small prototype cloud application developed to apply and extend the techniques and technologies learned as part of ECS781P-Cloud Computing at Queen Mary Univsersity of London.

BookReviewApp is a Flask application hosted on Amazon Web Services. The user can register with the application to maintain a list of book reviews. The application used Open Library's REST API to fetch book details. As per the guidelines, we have focussed on below areas in the development phase.
